### Contents of the repository

This repository contains various Python libraries that may help to reproduce all the results presented in the cited paper.

- lib_holes.py: This library contains basic functions such as the definition of effective 8KP, 6KP, 4KP, 2KP Hamiltonians in proximitized Germanium, both in 3D bulk and 2DHG models. There are also additional functions to find momentum values where zero-energy anticrossings lie.
- main_holes_figures.py: This library contains a extended code needed to reproduce all the plots shown in the cited paper
